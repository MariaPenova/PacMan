# 27 January
   * DONE
     * Clipped the exact portion of the sprite sheet which I needed using clip: rect() with a few adjustments
        * Added animation to it
        * Tried a lot of way to make the PacMan animation look like as if the character is moving based on the give direction 
          * I'll be needing help with this - Am I able to use the clipped part as a separate png so I can give to it width and height and make the animation looks like the character is moving on specific directions? (I want to use the clipped part as a separate image and choose which portions of the image to be shown and which to be with the property overflow: hidden;)
      * Investigated approaches of how to make the PacMan moving based on the pressed keyboard key
        * For this I will be using JavaScript
      * Pushed all of my progress to GitHub
    * DOs
      * Make the PacMan move 

# 26 January
  * DONE
    * Tried to crop a specific portion of the sprite sheet (in particular the PacMan character) with the following functions and neither of them did the exact thing I'm needing:
      * Clip() 
      * Clip-path()
        * Clip-path: inset()
        * Clip-path: polygon
      * Object-fit()
      * Object-position()
      * Transform: scale()
  * DOs
    * Make the PacMan move 
    * See how to read the keyboard (use the arrows)
    * See how to move the PacMan based on the pressed key

# 25 January

* DONE
  * Swiched to the sprite sheet with trancparancy 
    * Figured out that is better to use the sprite sheet wich does not contain the PacMan Labirynth with the dots because we would have to eventually remove the dots in the course of development of the game
  * Cleaned up the unnecessary files  
* DOs
  * Make the PacMan move
